### Bio
Born and raised in Portland, Oregon I've learned several important lessons that
serve me well:

<!--
  1. How to find the positives of rainy days
    - it's a great time to read or get work done
    - rain now means thriving plants and forests to come
    - the comfort of simply being warm and dry isn't always guaranteed, it's worth
      appreciating

  (In a form of climate-related Stockholm Syndrome, one can actually grow to
    *like* the rain ::mind-blown:: ::confused face::)
  2. Sometimes we have to go out in poor weather, when that happens you have a few
  options:
    - Be prepared, most hikers know: "There's no such thing as bad weather, just the wrong gear"
    - Accept that things aren't ideal, move on, and do what you can
     - the Dutch have articulated, "We're not made of sugar, we won't melt in the rain"
      - (a warm shower and a hot drink at the end of the day make a world of difference, too)
  3. The value of being present and making the most things when the sun does come out.

        Although rain can be uncomfortable for us, it also creates many scenes of
        natural beauty.
        Plus, rain now means being able to enjoy thriving plants and forests to come
      </li>

        Heavy rain <em>can</em> make things more difficult and a bit less pleasant, 
        but I also feel that when I go out anyway it's worth bonus points for perseverance.
        <br>
        I also find the world to feel a lot more peaceful when everyone else decides to stay home

    The value of being present, and making the most of things when the sun does come out.

</ol>

As time goes by I appreciate more and more that these lessons are helpful beyond
just the weather.

### Career
I have a natural curiosity which motivates me to understand how things work,
from bicycles and astrophysics to human behavior/psychology, economics, and
societal systems. I enjoy studying a problem and designing a solution that
efficiently addresses the cause and provides value to people by alleviating the
issue.

I am interested in Data Science, Data Engineering, and Machine Learning because
they propose more comprehensive approaches to problems and
allow us to broach problems that have previously been too complex to
analyze systematically.

It is a practice of mine to periodically review how I've spent my time and my work processes.
I want to make the most of each day and I've found it helpful to regularly
review my activities and evaluate what has gone well and what has not. I have
daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, and yearly reviews that I perform to
proportional levels of depth with the goal that the things I do on any given day
are contributing to my long-term goals. I find it helps give me a clearer sense
of purpose and makes me more effective since I have clarified what my goals are
and what I need to do to achieve them.

Most of the focus of these reviews is on work and projects
but I find that the process of defining my goals, planning a strategy, tracking my activity,
reflecting on my progress, and making incremental improvements is helpful in other
areas of life as well. It is a continually-evolving process as I frequently
tweak and improve my methods but hopefully that means the entire process is
getting better all the time!

### Hobbies & Interests
I have quite wide and varied interests.
- Professional - Active member of <a href="https://pdx.pydata.org">PyData PDX</a> - local Data Science industry group
- Outdoorsy - hiking, camping, skiing, surfing
- Exercise - cycling, running
- Intellectual - reading, urban design, economics & politics, psychology &
  sociology
- Artistic - drawing, cinema, I like listening to music but don't play an
instrument (yet)
- Travel - Across and all over the US several times, Hawaii, Mexico, Chile, Thailand, New
Zealand, Fiji, learning about other cultures and languages
- Time-wasting - very casual gamer, watching too much Netflix and Youtube

Pretty much anything has something that's interesting about it and I'm fortunate
enough to have a passable ability at most things so almost any activity holds
some appeal for me; and even if I'm bad, I've learned to still have fun.
So I may never conquer a hobby but I'm satisfied if I've sincerely enjoyed my time doing it.

And when was having fun supposed to be serious anyway?

### A Guiding Principle
Finally, a large influence in my life has been the good fortune to have many
members of my extended family live nearby. They have not only provided me with a
multitude of perspectives to consider and view the world, and much support over
the years, but also the experience of what it means to live in community with
people. Of course, there are many communities of various sizes, shapes, and
compositions in the world and many of them serve valuable needs. But the theory
that I've developed from my experiences is that communities that last are built
upon people within them willingly accepting some responsibiity towards one
another, encapsulated by one of my uncle's favorite aphorisms:

> If you want to go fast, go alone<br>
> If you want to go far, go together

Then the question that remains is simply: What communities do you want to build?

I'll see you out there.
