An open source expense management application sponsored by the Software Freedom
Conservancy in Portland, Oregon and created for my senior capstone project at
Portland State University.

Features for Clients:
- a "purchases wizard" that guided users on how to buy plane tickets,
hotel rooms, etc. so that they would be eligible for full reimbursement
- allowed users to upload photos and screenshots of receipts
  - easily document purchases as you go!
    - no more losing receipts and not getting reimbursed
  - no more collecting stacks of paper receipts
- get your expenses approved and reimbursed faster

Features for Businesses:
- Increase client adherence to reimbursement policy
  - get timely and complete proofs of purchases
- Facilitate accounting and ease tax compliance
- Reduce headaches and staff time spent reconciling expenses
